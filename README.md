*An example of PBR Decals in a scene.*

kDecals is a system for definition, placement and rendering of projection Decals in Unity's Universal Render Pipeline. It comes with Lit and Unlit Decal types by default and supports custom Decal shaders using a predefined Shader Library. kDecals supports Decal creation in Editor and runtime and supports pooling of runtime decals by default via [kPooling](https://github.com/Kink3d/kPooling).
